John,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)


However,

- The evidence of setting up the java compiler (javac) is missing, which is a
  really big deal. Please make sure you have that correctly installed and
  setup. Please come to see me if you need help.

- You were asked to name your .pdf file hw0lastname.pdf where "lastname" is
  your last name, but you did not follow instructions.

- Please be careful in following instructions in the future.

- A little header or cover page with your name, class, assignment, date, etc.
  is always good to have in any assignment of this type.

- You did not bring the assignment in printed version by the deadline.

- You must submit your assignments on time.


Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
